# Skin-cancer-detection
The Skin Cancer Detection Project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying skin lesion images into benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) categories. Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and early detection plays a critical role in improving patient outcomes. This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to assist dermatologists in diagnosing skin cancer more effectively.

## Dataset used 
The dataset used in this project is the [Skin Cancer: Malignant vs. Benign](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign) dataset
This dataset contains a balanced dataset of images of benign skin moles and malignant skin moles.
