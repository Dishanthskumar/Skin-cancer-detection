# Skin-cancer-detection
Skin Cancer is recognized as one of the
dangerous forms of cancer which proves to be fatal if not
diagnosed at a early stage. Skin cancer has a tendency to
progressively extend to other areas of the body, making it
difficult to cure in the latter stages, this is precisely why it
is crucial to identify it during the initial phases. The
increasing incidence of skin cancer, accompanied by high
mortality rates and costly medical treatments, underscores
the importance of early detection and diagnosis of its
symptoms. Given the gravity of these concerns, several
techniques have been developed by researchers to detect
skin cancer at the premature stage. Parameters like color, size, shape, asymmetry, diameter etc. are used to predict
skin cancer and to distinguish benign(non-melanoma)
skin cancer from melanoma. A model-driven architecture
incorporating deep learning algorithms has been
employed to develop enhanced models for skin cancer
prediction. The study showcases the process of
constructing these models and their application in
accurately classifying dermal cell images. The model
proposed by us has been trained and tested over 3297
different images of both malignant and benign lesions
chosen from the ISIC Archive. We achieved an accuracy
of 86% and to enhance comprehension, our research
findings are conveyed through visual representations such
as graphs, tables, and pictorial illustration
