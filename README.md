# Skin-cancer-detection
The Skin Cancer Detection Project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying skin lesion images into benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) categories. Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and early detection plays a critical role in improving patient outcomes. This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to assist dermatologists in diagnosing skin cancer more effectively.
